<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Temperature Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-temperature prepreg market can be categorized into two main processing types: autoclave processing and out-of-autoclave (OOA) processing. Autoclave processing involves the use of high-pressure and temperature chambers to cure composite materials, ensuring optimal material properties and void-free structures. In contrast, OOA processing utilizes alternative techniques, such as vacuum bagging or resin infusion, allowing for lower-cost, more flexible manufacturing but may result in variations in material properties. Both methods are crucial for aerospace, automotive, and advanced manufacturing applications.</p></p>
