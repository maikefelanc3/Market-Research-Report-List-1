<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artemisinin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extraction From Artemisia Annua</li><li>Semisynthetic Artemisinin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artemisinin market is divided into two main types: extraction from Artemisia annua and semisynthetic Artemisinin. Extraction from Artemisia annua involves obtaining the active ingredient directly from the plant, which has been traditionally used for its antimalarial properties. In contrast, semisynthetic Artemisinin is produced through chemical processes that convert precursor compounds, often derived from renewable resources or synthesized materials, into Artemisinin. Both types are crucial for developing affordable and effective antimalarial treatments.</p></p>
