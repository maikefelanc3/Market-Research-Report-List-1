<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Pulse And Heart Rate Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Reflection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Optical Pulse and Heart Rate Sensor market is primarily categorized into two types: Transmission and Reflection. Transmission sensors measure heart rate by emitting light through a finger, allowing the sensor to capture changes in light intensity caused by pulsing blood. In contrast, Reflection sensors work by emitting light onto the skin and measuring the light that reflects back, analyzing variations in reflection to determine heart rate. Both methods utilize optical technology to provide accurate and non-invasive measurements of heart activity.</p></p>
